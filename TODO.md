# Stuff I should do:

1. Consider replacing qbittorrent with rtorrent + webui
2. Consider replacing plex with jellyfin (will lose plex networking)
3. Figure out how to manage permissions properly (right now I'm just `chod 777`ing the `./downloads` and `./media` folders to solve these issues)
4. Consider migrating all your data from local install
